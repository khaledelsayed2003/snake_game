🧩 How It Works (quick notes)

The snake is a list of turtle.Turtle segments; the head drives movement.

Each frame, segments copy the previous segment’s position → “follow” effect.

Eating food:

    Food.refresh() teleports the food to a new random spot.

    Score.refresh() increments the score.

    Snake.extend() adds a new tail segment.

Collisions:

    Wall collision if head x/y crosses ±285 (600×600 screen).

    Tail collision if the head is within distance < 10 of any body segment.
