A beginner version of the classic **Snake Game** made with Python's built-in `turtle` library.  
This project is still in development — currently testing basic movement logic.

- Moves the parts forward (prototype version).

## 🧠 To-Do

- Add controls for the snake (Up, Down, Left, Right).
- Detect collisions and scoring.

## ▶️ How to Run
```bash
python main.py
